Welcome to the **Affinity** backend repository! This project is powered by the blazing-fast [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) framework, built using **Rust** to handle API requests and efficiently communicate with a **PostgreSQL** database. Our backend is optimized for high performance and scalability, designed to meet the demands of modern applications.


## PerOxO Module ‚Äì Microservices & Actor Concurrency Engine
PerOxO is a core backend engine within the Affinity system designed for high-throughput real-time features like messaging and presence.

 Key Highlights:
- **Actor Model Concurrency:** Built using Rust‚Äôs asynchronous capabilities to ensure isolated, concurrent actor execution per user session.
- **Microservice Architecture:** Operates as an independent service, enabling decoupled scaling and service separation.
- **gRPC Communication:** Interfaces with other Affinity services using performant, schema-defined gRPC calls.
- **WebSocket Integration:** Handles persistent user connections, routes messages, and manages session lifecycles.
This module lives as a subproject under ./per_oxo/ and can be built, tested, and deployed independently.
