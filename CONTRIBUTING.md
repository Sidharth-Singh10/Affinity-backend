Title: Add pagination to GET /api/resources

Description: Implement pagination to reduce the load when fetching large datasets. This will enhance user experience and improve performance for endpoints returning numerous resources.

Use cases:
- This would be particularly useful for endpoints that return a large number of resources, making it easier for clients to handle and process the data.
- Users can navigate through results more efficiently without overwhelming the interface.

Mockup: (Optional, add any design or mockup if relevant)
```
